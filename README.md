## Features

### ConsultBuddy.AI

Plan your career and education with personalized insights from your AI consultant friend! ConsultBuddy empowers students, especially from underserved communities, with tailored career and education plans, and job opportunities, that align with their interests and aspirations, even possibly ones they may not have thought of before. Students from underserved communities may be first-generation students who have no one to ask for guidance. With ConsultBuddy.AI, we are creating an environment where everyone can compete with equal access to information.

### Tracker Pal

Achieve measurable targets and receive AI-generated feedback, based on the evaluation of your work, to get the most out of it. With Tracker Pal, students from underserved communities will gain the same level of access as those with private tutors, creating a level playing field.

### Super Bestie

Getting acquainted with new role models will expand your knowledge and build valuable networks. We foster a positive community where users support each other. It will be especially useful for first-generation students seeking mentors. Students who have participated in Super Bestie in the past are encouraged to become Super Besties themselves, growing a pool of role models to inspire many more students in the future.
